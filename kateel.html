<p style="text-align:justify;">Kateel or Kateelu is a small temple town located in the Dakshina Kannada district of Karnataka, India. The town is known for the Kateel Durga Parameshwari Temple, dedicated to Goddess Durga Parameshwari. The story behind the Kateel Temple is a blend of mythology and historical legends. <br>According to the legend, the temple's history is associated with the sage Jabali. It is believed that Jabali performed severe penance to seek the blessings of Goddess Durga. Pleased with his devotion, Goddess Durga appeared before him and asked him to choose a boon. Jabali requested the goddess to accompany him to his hermitage, and the goddess agreed. <br>As time passed, the goddess became a part of Jabali's daily rituals. However, the sage's wife, unaware of the divine presence, would unknowingly interrupt the rituals by placing the offering on the goddess's head instead of the plate. The goddess, in turn, would accept the offerings with a smile. <br>One day, the sage's wife realized that there was a divine presence in the hermitage, and she informed her husband. Sage Jabali, upon learning the truth, apologized to the goddess and requested her to stay at the place where she had been worshipped. The goddess agreed and transformed herself into a stone idol, which is now worshipped as Goddess Durga Parameshwari in the Kateel Temple. <br>Another legend associated with the temple involves the sage Agasthya. It is said that the goddess instructed the sage to install her idol at Kateel, and he did so, marking the establishment of the Kateel Durga Parameshwari Temple. <br>The temple is situated on an islet formed by the river Nandini, and the entrance to the temple is through a wooden bridge. The annual festival called "Kateel Rathotsava" or the chariot festival is a major celebration, drawing thousands of devotees. During this festival, the goddess is taken out in a grand procession on a beautifully decorated chariot.

    The Kateel Temple is not only a significant pilgrimage site but also an architectural and cultural landmark, reflecting the rich traditions and devotion of the region. </p>
